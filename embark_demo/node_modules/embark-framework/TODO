* check syntax errors




* deploying many contrats sometimes it times out, in that case it should try again
* it seems to redeploy contracts when using inheratice
* support javascript in the contract arguments
* support naming the parameters
* support $Account

* serpent compile cash.se
* serpent mk_full_signature cash.se

solc --input-file app/contracts/simple_storage.sol --combined-json binary,json-abi

console command
loads js console with contracts instantiated
repl = require "repl"

css files not trigger refresh

estimate gas
solc app/contracts/simple_storage.sol --gas

Bugs:
* adding a new contract does not trigger a redeploy
* add check for deployment
* on deploy it should check for deployment errors

Idea: for running blockchain command
* use echo command to require embark and run tests
* e.g <(require('embark-framework').mine() )


* do a test case first
* 1. create node js file
* 2. create simple function with callback
* 3. create function that uses it
* 4. make it work with promises
* 5. make it work with several promises
* 6. make it work in order
* 7. make it work synchrously 

sudo npm install -g cordova

* make binary look for yml file and check app type
* if grunt work as now
* if meteor work 'manually'
* make 'run' command deploy the stuff manually as expected
* do this inside a meteor app
** make need to do a package
* add 'watch' feature
* make a scaffold/demo feature

- contracts as arguments to other contracts
- persistent contracts - don't redeploy if they are already deployed
- stubs - addresses to already existing contracts
- data structures (contracts with structs, crud, and 'authorized owners' management
- client side deployable contracts (e.g wallets)
- contracts instances - deploy the same contract with different arguments

DeployOnlyDeclaredContracts: true
//InstanceOf: Currency
deploy: false
//Address: 0x123
DeployableOnClient: true
Stub: abi

check if all_contracts var includes files that arent defined
